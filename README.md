Code for the manuscript "Single-cell analysis of human primary prostate cancer reveals the heterogeneity of tumor-associated epithelial cell states"
Add V0 of raw analysis files to this repository. More documentation and comments will be added in the figure. 

TheSeurat objects (all cells and epithelial cells, separately) are now in a Dropbox folder and they could be loaded with readRDS() in R. The active.ident would include our annotation and the orig.ident would be the patient ID. The count matrix could be exported from the .rds object. We renamed the cells in the object to make them shorter (perhaps I shouldn't have done this).
